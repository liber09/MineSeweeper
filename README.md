Welcome to Bomb Panic 2

… a minesweeper based fun game!

How it works:

You are given the choice to choose between 35 different board sizes on a scale from 6x6 to 40x40 and 3 different types of difficulty who determine how many bombs there will be ( its about a 10 percentage for easy about 15 % for medium and 20% for hard)

The game runs on time, how much time you have is calculated accordingly to the bord size you have chosen. 

When the game starts you got can choose to uncover a tile - get a hint( you get three hints in total) or flag a tile.

If you detect a tile with no bombs around, you will uncover all the other tiles surrounding the safe tile, if you uncover a tile with one or more bombs surrounding it, you will only open up this tile, which will indicate the number of bombs nearby - meaning that a/the bomb(s) are either
on the right, the left, upp, down, upp to the left, upp to the right, down to the left or/and down to the right of this tile.

You are also able to give up at any time.


Rules:
3 ways to win: 
- if you mark all the right bombs - and no false ones you win !
- If you uncover all the tiles that aren’t bombs - you win!
- If you mark some right bombs and uncover everything but the unmarked bombs - you win!
2 ways to die:
- If you click on a bomb
- If your time is up and you failed to discover all the bombs

Good Luck.  TLLJ-Games
